There are a lot of people who use both apps regularly;</p><h3>Generally Speaking A Sketch Is A Loose, Unrefined Early Inspiration Towards A Final Drawing.</h3><br/><p>Certain pencil drawings where an artist draws the skin textures will take days or even months, unlike sketching, which can be done in minutes and hours.
