The bulb cost usd 40,000 (about usd 850,000 in today&#039;s money) and burned for slightly more than half a day. He demonstrated his light bulb in december 1879.</p><h3>Edison Simply Replied That This Experimentation Had Delivered Him That Number Of Materials He Now Knew, Didnât Work!</h3><br/><p>Then, a year before edison completed his bulb in 1878, another british chemist joseph swan publicly demonstrated the first light using cheaper carbon, but his use of thicker filaments still led to. Draw two of these bending in different directions. So how did edison win in such a crowded field when he was so far behind?</p><h3>Edison Made The First Public Demonstration Of His Incandescent Light Bulb On December 31, 1879, In Menlo Park.</h3><br/><p>In fact, historians have documented the fact that more than 20 people preceded edison with a working electric light bulb, some being his contemporaries. And by 1884, over 10,000 âedison lightsâ were in use in new york.
