I have been trying to find a drawing app like procreate to use with the surface pen but couldn’t match the experience. In either auto or manual line snap modes, just stop and press the control key before changing direction.</p></section><section><aside><img title="9 Lazy Nezumi Ideas | Lazy, Art Apps, Photoshop" alt="9 Lazy Nezumi Ideas | Lazy, Art Apps, Photoshop" rel="nofollow" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9e/96/40/9e964064ba005b2ccd898b8069439825.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small></center><br><p>Great for slow, detailed work with sharp corners.
