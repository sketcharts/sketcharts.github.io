<section><h3>In This Type, Constant Touch Between The Cam And The Follower Is Maintained By A Roller Follower Operating In The Groove Of A Cam.</h3><br/><p>A cam is a mechanical member used to impart desired motion or displacement to a follower by direct contact. It is also used as a hydraulic system. Radial or disc cams • a cam in which the follower moves radially from the centre of rotation of the cam is known as a radial or a disc cam (fig.</p><h3>Β= Cam Rotation Angle At Which The Follower Reaches The Maximum Height (Lift).</h3><br/><p>Draw a base circle with radius equal to the minimum radius of the cam (i.e.50 mm) Design a mechanical system based on a cylindrical cam and follower(s) that controls the vertical motion of the forks. Follower type = knife edged follower, in line;</p><h3>The Mechanism Of Cam And Follower Is Essential In The Engineering Field And Has Many Different Functions To The Different Machines.</h3><br/><p>Because the mechanism is dependent on the fluid pressure. Draw your design on the enlarged diagram below adding labels to identify the parts. Following are the applications of cam and follower:</p><h3>A Familiar Example Is The Camshaft Of An Automobile Engine, Where The Cams Drive The Push.</h3><br/><p>The weight of the follower keeps them in contact. Dwell for 45 0 cam rotation; Cam and follower are used in the i.c engine to close and open the outlet valve and intake valve.</p><h3>Cam And Follower Are Employed In Printing Machinery For Printing The Screen.</h3><br/><p>This is called a gravity constraint cam. Cam profile is the outer surface of the disc cam. Add notes to explain how your system works.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Design and Drawing of CAM profiles" alt="Design and Drawing of CAM profiles" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/image.slidesharecdn.com/unit-8-cams-130404060235-phpapp01/95/slide-21-1024.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small></center><br><p>In a cam follower pair, the cam normally rotates while the follower may translate or oscillate.
