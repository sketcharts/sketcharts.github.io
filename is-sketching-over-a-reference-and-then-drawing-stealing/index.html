<section><h3>Is Drawing From Reference Bad?</h3><br/><p>Some anime shows have begun limiting the amount of fan. Is drawing from reference good? Most of the time the penalties are more social—you can get banned from the community—but you can also be hit with heavy fines and jail time if you&#039;re not careful.</p><h3>The Only Way To Grow Is To Learn How To Draw.</h3><br/><p>Divide your figure into equal sections. If i only sell fan art at conventions, and not online or in stores, it is okay. See here for more details.</p><h3>If This Is The Case, Then Multiple Sheets May Be Used.</h3><br/><p>Place a graphite sheet behind a photocopy of your reference photo. Submit translation fixes (or more languages!) here. Art theft is taking something that you did not create yourself and reposting it/editing it and claiming it as your own.</p><h3>Navigate Over To The Insert Menu And Locate Reference Geometry &gt; Plane.</h3><br/><p>This may be the most obvious benefit with tracing. Fix bugs and add new features on github. You now have an additional working plane that is parallel to the existing right plane.</p><h3>It Does Mean Learning To Observe And Place Marks Accurately Enough.</h3><br/><p>There are techniques to make drawing easier. Click in the sketch or document where you want to paste the center of the sketch. Trace the key areas of the image with a sharpish pencil.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Arash Rod&#039;s Art Hands and Feet Drawings (Good as references)" alt="Arash Rod&#039;s Art Hands and Feet Drawings (Good as references)" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKH81BTVILA/T_KNi7cZNlI/AAAAAAAAAb0/eB16gphGRkE/s1600/p12.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small></center><br><p>Divide your figure into equal sections.
