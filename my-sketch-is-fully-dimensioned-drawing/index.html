Using the hide/show icons for the reference sketch come in real handy to monitor your progress. Holding down shift while you nudge multiplies the increment by a factor of ten).</p><h3>The First Dimension Line Should Be.</h3><br/><p>Designers need to fully dimension a part to provide the width, height, and depth so the person that is manufacturing the sketch doesn't dimension it wrong. Dimension features of a part that are left, not to those features being cut away as scrap. We will discuss tolerances later, but for now assume that the part must be dimensioned to the thousandth of an inch in order to insure sufficient dimensional accuracy.</p><h3>Featureworks Recognition Of Sketch Constraints Depends On The Options You Select.</h3><br/><p>When a sketch is over dimensioned, it just simply has repeated dimensions on. Enable auto dimensioning of sketches. “hint it is not fully constrained” (6 pts) section 5:</p><h3>They Way It Accomplishes This Is By Adding Weak Dimensions And Constraints.</h3><br/><p>You can have a sketch that is fully dimensioned, but not constrained to the origin point.
