One of my favourite things about sanders sides is how all of them, even the more obviously antagonistic ones, are ultimately trying to act in thomas’ best.

He should not let these little things bother him, but for some reason every time something happened that didn&#039;t go his way his eyes watered up and he had this awful feeling. In the series, thomas projects the different aspects of his personality into four main characters called the sanders sides.</p><h3>A Bunch Of Sander Sides Drawings I’m Never Going To Finish But They Get Increasingly More Edgy :).</h3><br/><p>Well since i drew that iz!roman sketch, i had to draw his bro again.
