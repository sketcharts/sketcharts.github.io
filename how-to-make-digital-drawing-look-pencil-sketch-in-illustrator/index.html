<section><h3>Import Your Scanned Image Into Illustrator.</h3><br/><p>Import the scan with shift + command + p, then hit place and click on an artboard to see your drawing pop up within illustrator. Once this is all done, open up your page design, copy over your elements, and begin to lay them out as you did in your pencil sketch, keeping in mind what we discussed earlier about the principle of uneven spacing and being. When you place a raster image in illustrator, a toolbar will appear at top of your artboard.</p><h3>Set The Mode To Draw Inside.</h3><br/><p>Fotosketcher is a free program which can help you convert your digital images into art automatically using fully adjustable filters. There are two methods for changing the colors of anything on your layer: Release the clipping mask for a second to access the outline and copy it.</p><h3>In The Edit Menu, Select Edit Colors And Then Convert To Grayscale.</h3><br/><p>Choose the shape of the brush tip. After you’ve scanned in your pencil drawing, you can transform it into a digital image using a custom brush, or combination of different brushes. You want to make the digital sketch look as good as the original—not better!</p><h3>Finally, Adobe Illustrator And Photoshop.</h3><br/><p>In the artboards panel, go to the layers tab. A strategy that helps some people is to scan their pencil sketch and lay it over their design at 60% opacity to help them place objects more quickly. Next we convert the drawing to grayscale, which i am told makes it easier to trace by the adobe illustrator.</p><h3>Again, Make Sure Your Work Is In A Finished State, Preferably Black And White.</h3><br/><p>Those are the bread and butter of digital art, so make sure that you prioritize learning how those operate, as they’ll make your life as an artist much easier. Add these by going to the window option in the top left and selecting each one (window &gt; stroke, window &gt; artboards, etc). Graphic design is also used for making posters and artwork.</p></section><section><aside><img title="How To Convert Photo Into Pencil Sketch In Cs6" alt="How To Convert Photo Into Pencil Sketch In Cs6" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.ytimg.com/vi/S3KlKP6mylQ/maxresdefault.jpg" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small></center><br><p>Color by locking the pixels: Your canvas size doesn’t really matter for the purpose of using the live trace tool, so you can go ahead and select any default canvas size.
