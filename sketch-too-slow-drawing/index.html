<section><h3>These Are The Available Options For Drawings:</h3><br/><p>Click options, click advanced in the left pane of the powerpoint options dialog box, and then under display, ensure the disable hardware graphics acceleration check box is not selected. Use hardware graphics acceleration click the file tab. My sketchup is acting very slow too… purge doesn’t seem to work, but i was able to copy and paste my model into a new file, resave, and now the file is 10% the size of the original and runs much faster.</p><h3>It Is Something That It Is Called Sketch Diagnostics That Is Slow, This Is The Calculation That Tells You If There Are Any Conflicting/Redundant Constraints And How Many Degrees Of Freedom A Sketch Contains.</h3><br/><p>After checking common issues like working with files over a network and graphics card/driver issue we were able to rule these out. The program has become so slow it’s impossible to get anything done in a timely manor. Uncheck layers really helps with the speed.</p><h3>Been Using Sketchup And Layout For The Last 3 Or 4 Years Or So.</h3><br/><p>Layout too slow to use. These are ordered from fastest (quick view) to slowest (resolved). If this is too small, too large, or uneven, the material can be cracked during drawing.</p><h3>The Main Reasons Programs Would Be Slow Or Laggy Would Be:</h3><br/><p>Also, how many pages in the file obviously impacts the export time. It is almost un workable. Does anybody know what the problem is?</p><h3>Copying And Pasting The Model Took About 20 Minutes, However, Which Is Still A Long Time.</h3><br/><p>The sketch i am translating uses at least 25 different ‘nut’ forms and sizes, so making that many different obj files is too much work. These problems accumulate, but you keep going—when you add the colors, nobody will notice something&#039;s wrong. I find that selecting or command selecting items within groups is very slow and shows a longer spinner at zoom levels of 100% vs 25% for example.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Slow steps » drawings » SketchPort" alt="Slow steps » drawings » SketchPort" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/lh5.ggpht.com/FwInb1anSmD5mX4HhIw2hkYZ23vP6x8vZGfY21m4Ql_XCLXRWItcbro7eu3VCz9V0YvjSBjD2ZkCljrX6wVRLvWkyjBC=s600-c" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small></center><br><p>After checking common issues like working with files over a network and graphics card/driver issue we were able to rule these out.

Fracturing of the metal during the draw process can be caused by several issues although the most common is the clearance between the punch and the die.
